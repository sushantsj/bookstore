In the high-level diagram, we have outlined the main components of the Bookstore Application. It includes entities like Book, Author, Category, Inventory, Order, and Customer. The arrows represent the relationships between the entities, such as one-to-many and many-to-one relationships.<br>

# Low-Level Design (LLD):

# Book, Author, and Category: 
These entities will represent books, their authors, and categories. They will be implemented as Java classes with appropriate attributes and relationships. The relationships between Book, Author, and Category will be defined using annotations like @ManyToOne, @OneToMany, etc.<br>
# Inventory:  
The Inventory component will manage the stock of books in the bookstore. It will implement Java's concurrent libraries to ensure data consistency and prevent conflicts during high-demand scenarios.<br>
# Order and Customer: 
The Order and Customer components will handle customer orders and customer data, respectively.
The relationships between Order and Customer will be established for tracking order history.<br>
# Factory Pattern:
Implement a BookFactory to create different types of Book objects based on their genres.<br>
# Singleton Pattern:
Implement a Singleton class for BookInventory to ensure only one instance of it exists throughout the application.<br>
# Multithreading and Join Tables:
Utilize multithreading for concurrent processing of orders and inventory management.<br>
Use join tables for establishing many-to-many relationships between entities like Book and Category.
# Caching:
Implement caching for frequently accessed data like books and categories using Spring's @Cacheable annotation.<br>
# Streams and Java Collections: 
Use Java Streams for data processing tasks like filtering and mapping.<br>
Utilize Java Collections for managing data structures like lists and maps.<br>
# Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) Concepts:
Adhere to OOPs principles like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism throughout the application.<br>
# Latest Spring Annotations:
Use modern Spring annotations like @Autowired, @Component, @Service, @Repository, etc., for dependency injection and component scanning.<br>
